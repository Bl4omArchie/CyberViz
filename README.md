# Cyberviz

CyberViz is a framework for data visualization and manipulation of large dataset written in python.
The main purpose of the tool is to help people understanding one or several dataset correctly and perfom plenty of operation like AI training, dynamic visualization with graphs and more.

As the name suggest, this tool is oriented for cybersecurity so I'm principally developping features for security dataset like csv, pcap or logs.

Features :
- Data visualization of your dataset
- Dashboard using streamling for data plotting

# Use cases

1- Open dataset
2- Dataset manipulation
3- Data visualization

# TODO 

- Work on the file opening with dask and streamlit dashboard
- Add method for visualization and analyze
- Add plotting on streamlit
