# Cyberviz

CyberViz is a framework for data visualization and manipulation of large dataset written in python.
The main purpose of the tool is to help people understanding one or several dataset correctly and perfom plenty of operation like AI training, dynamic visualization with graphs and more.

As the name suggest, this tool is oriented for cybersecurity so I'm principally developping features for security dataset like csv, pcap or logs.

Features :
- Open .csv and .pcap dataset 
- Data visualization with graphics
- Dashboard using streamling
- Detect attack patterns



# Goals

v0 to v1 :
- streamlit dashboard :
    - drag and drop âœ…
    - page for dataset âœ…
    - dataset manipulation ðŸš§
- cyberviz framework for csv and pcap âœ…
- dataset analytic ðŸš§

TODO :
- Fix graphical bugs for pages
- Improve dashboard for dataset manipulation
